# System Usability Scale (SUS)

Brooke's standard 10 items, each answered from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Record the answers in `results/sus.csv` as `q1`…`q10`. Keep the standard wording; the score is only comparable with it.

| # | Statement | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | I think that I would like to use this system frequently. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | I found the system unnecessarily complex. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | I thought the system was easy to use. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | I found the various functions in this system were well integrated. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 6 | I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 8 | I found the system very cumbersome to use. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | I felt very confident using the system. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system. | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

**Scoring** (done by `scripts/usability_report.py`): odd items score `answer − 1`, even items `5 − answer`. The sum × 2.5 gives each participant a score from 0 to 100; the study's SUS is the mean.
